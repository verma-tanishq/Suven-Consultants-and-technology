The main objective in this Internship Project is to predict the sentiment for a number of movie
reviews obtained from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). This dataset contains 50,000
movie reviews that have been pre-labeled with “positive” and “negative” sentiment class labels
based on the review content. Besides this, there are additional movie reviews that are
unlabeled.<br />\
The dataset can be obtained from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ ,
courtesy of Stanford University and Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan
Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. They have datasets in the form of raw text as well
as already processed bag of words formats. We will only be using the raw labeled movie
reviews for our analyses.<br />\
Hence our task will be to predict the sentiment of 15,000 labeled movie reviews and use the
remaining 35,000 reviews for training our supervised models.
